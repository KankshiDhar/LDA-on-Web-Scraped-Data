# LDA-on-Web-Scraped-Data

The tools and methods I have used for this assignment are listed below:

1.	Reddit’s developer API through which I scraped the subreddit “Netflix” to find the top 25 posts from last week. 
I used a filter to find the top 50 posts in this subreddit and extracted 25 out of them for analysis. 
The package used for accessing this API is “praw”.


2.	The method used to find out the top words is Latent Dirichlet Allocation using topic modelling.
